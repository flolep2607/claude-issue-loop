description: Runs the issue loop on the current GitHub repository — files new issues from one-line requests with the issue-writer agent, and hands agent-ready issues, answered questions and PR review comments to issue-solver agents. Use for "file an issue for…", "work the issues", or under /loop to keep the queue moving.
argument-hint: "[request to file as an issue]"

GitHub issues are the queue and the conversation. The user files or comments
from anywhere — the phone included — and this loop turns that into work. Agent
text ends with the marker `<!-- issue-loop-agent -->`; everything else on an
issue is the user's, because every agent posts under the user's own account.

## Settings

Read `.claude/issue-loop.md` if it exists. Its front matter may rename the
labels (`label_ready`, `label_working`, `label_question`, `label_pr`) and set
`max_solvers` (default 3). Use those values wherever this page says the
default. If the labels do not exist (`gh label list`), say that
`/issue-loop:setup` has not been run here, and stop.

## Labels

| label | meaning | who moves it on |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-ready` | written and waiting for a solver | this loop |
| `agent-working` | a solver has it, with a draft PR from `issue-<N>` | the solver |
| `agent-question` | the solver asked on the issue and stopped | the user's reply |
| `agent-pr` | the PR is ready for review, CI watched | the user: merge, or review comments |

## With arguments: file issues

`/issues <request>` — spawn one `issue-loop:issue-writer` agent per request (in
parallel for several) and report the URLs. If a writer returns a question, ask
the user it rather than filing.

## Without arguments: one pass over the queue

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label agent-ready    --json number,title,body
gh issue list --state open --label agent-question --json number,title
gh issue list --state open --label agent-pr       --json number,title
gh issue list --state open --label agent-working  --json number,title
```

1. **agent-ready** — spawn a background `issue-loop:issue-solver` with the
   number, up to `max_solvers` at once in total; more wait for the next pass.
   Issues that touch the same code go to **one** solver together (`Solve #148
   and #149`): one PR instead of two that conflict, or one waiting on the
   other. Group by the files the issues name, not by label. An issue that says
   it waits for another can instead join that issue's solver while it is
   still running — send it the number.
2. **agent-question** — look at the last comment (`gh issue view <N> --json
   comments --jq '.comments[-1].body'`). Without the marker, the user has
   answered: relabel `agent-ready` and spawn a solver; it resumes from the
   branch and the conversation. With it, the question is still open — skip.
3. **agent-pr** — find the PR (`gh pr list --search "Fixes #<N>" --state all`).
   Merged: nothing to do; GitHub closed the issue. Open with review comments or
   issue comments newer than the solver's last marked one, or failing CI: spawn
   a solver to address them. Otherwise skip.
4. **agent-working** with no solver from this session running on it — a
   solver that died, or one from a session that ended. Its draft PR
   (`gh pr list --head issue-<N> --json number,updatedAt`) is the state: if it
   has not moved for an hour, spawn a solver; it resumes from the draft's
   Progress section. Issues labelled by hand for work outside this loop — a
   branch not named `issue-<N>`, so no draft — are someone else's: skip them.

Never spawn a second solver for an issue whose solver from this session is
still running. Report the pass in a few lines: what started, what is waiting on
the user, which PRs are ready to merge.

Merging, version bumps and releases stay with the user. This loop never does
them, and never asks a solver to.

## Under /loop

`/loop /issues` paces itself; between passes the solvers run in the background
and their completion re-invokes the loop. When nothing is running and nothing
is queued, wake in about 20 minutes to look for new issues and replies —
soon enough for an issue filed from a phone, without polling GitHub for a
queue that is usually empty.
